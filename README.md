# Thapar Sports Management System
## We are developing a website for Thapar Students so they can issue sports equipment from their own device, which will solve the problem of students going to the sports center and standing in long queues to get the equipment issued.<br>

This project will reduce the time that is consumed while issuing the equipment and also tries to inform the student of how many pieces of equipment are present in the inventory at that time. Also this project also mentions the time of issuing and how much time is left with the student to return the equipment back to the sports center so it can be accessed by the other students.<br>

We have also implemented a system where students will get to know their fine amount if they are returning any item late.

This system aims to simplify issuing and managing sports equipment by providing an online platform that can be accessed from anywhere at the convenience of the user.<br>
